=head1 Name

C<resty.core.time> - utility functions for time operations.


=head1 Status

This Lua module is currently considered production ready.


=head1 Synopsis


    location = /t {
        content_by_lua_block {
            local time = require "resty.core.time"
            ngx.say(time.monotonic_time())
            ngx.say(time.monotonic_msec())
        }
    }

The value get by C<"resty.core.time".monotonic_time> should equal to the value from /proc/uptime.




=head1 Description

This module provides utility functions for the time operations.




=head1 Methods


=head2 monotonic_msec

B<syntax:> I<monotonic_msec()>

Returns the elapsed time in milliseconds from the machine boot for the current time stamp from the Nginx cached time (no syscall involved unlike Lua's date library).


    local cur_msec = require "resty.core.time".monotonic_msec
    ngx.say(cur_msec())
    

This api was first introduced in lua-resty-core v0.1.25.




=head2 monotonic_time

B<syntax:> I<monotonic_time()>

Returns a floating-point number for the elapsed time in seconds (including milliseconds as the decimal part) from the machine boot for the current time stamp from the Nginx cached time (no syscall involved unlike Lua's date library).


    local cur_time = require "resty.core.time".monotonic_time
    ngx.say(cur_time())
    

This api was first introduced in lua-resty-core v0.1.25.
